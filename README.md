# Graph Attention Networks (GAT) - PyTorch
Reproducing Graph Attention Networks by Velickovic et al.
By Oliver Warwick, Pavlos Piperis, Khalil Ibrahim and Lood van Niekerk

This repo contains all of the code for our implentation of the GAT layer and everything needed to run it.

The information below details how to get the code running locally via the command line. However, we strongly recommend using the jupyter notebook (Reproduce_Experiments.ipynb) to do this instead. It is both simpler and more visually appealing, whilst still being able to display the complete functionality of our solution.

## Setup
The necessary environmental setup can be done automatically through conda and the provided yaml file. Given that the whole team use Mac, we only have the necessary setup file for this. 

```
conda env create -f env/gat_req_mac_version.yml
conda activate ATML_HT
```

For any other environment, we recommend setting up the notebook and running shell commands from there.

## Example Usage


TODO(Lood): train.py, vis.py etc

TODO(Lood) include plots
