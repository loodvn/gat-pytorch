# Graph Attention Networks (GAT) - PyTorch
Reproducing Graph Attention Networks by Velickovic et al.
By Oliver Warwick, Pavlos Piperis, Khalil Ibrahim and Lood van Niekerk

This repo contains all of the code for our implentation of the GAT layer and everything needed to run it.

The information below details how to get the code running locally via the command line. However, we strongly recommend using the jupyter notebook (Reproduce_Experiments.ipynb) to do this instead. It is both simpler and more visually appealing, whilst still being able to display the complete functionality of our solution. 

## Setup
The necessary environmental setup can be done automatically through conda and the provided yaml files. Use gat_req_mac_version.yml for Mac and gat_req_windows_version.yml for any other devices. None of our team run linux abd so have not verified the use of yyy on this OS, though it has been tested on windows.

```
conda env create -f env/<yml-file>
conda activate ATML_HT
```

## Example Usage

TODO(Lood): train.py, vis.py etc

TODO(Lood) include plots
